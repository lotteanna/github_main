# This is the README on how to use gitHub


I created this README using the next steps:
- Sign up to github on github.com
- Download the github client (for mac or windows)
- Create a new repository
- Open github application on local machine
- Clone newly created repository to desired directory
- Create a text file in this desired directory
- Save it
- Go to github application
- Commit to changes in file
-
